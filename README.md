# Optima-Partical_Size

* This repository is from working at my Summer Intership at Optima Powerware.
* I was able to work with Neural Networks and controls.

This repo contains everything from small scripts needed when manipulating data, to Testing models, to Training approaches.

### Checkout V2/
* V2/ contains code written after learning a lot about Neural Networks. I restarted about halfway through the summer to build a better structure for the Nueral Networks being used.
